      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
        language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
        objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
      <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
        language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
        extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
        <ul id="introduction-list">
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and
            its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to
            place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and
            page navigation.</li>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
            JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate
            with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
            application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
      <header>Hello World</header>
      <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
        JavaScript code:
        <code>
  function greetMe(yourName) {

    alert("Hello " + yourName);
  
  }
  
  greetMe("World");
        </code>
        Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
        identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
      <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters
        can
        also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z"
        (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
      <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape
        sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

      <header>Data types</header>
      <p>
        The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
        <ul>
          <li>Six data types that are primitives:
            <ul>
              <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
              <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the
                same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
              <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
              <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
              <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
              <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>and Object</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your
        applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
        objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>

      <header>if...else statement</header>
      <p>
        Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to
        execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
        <code>
  if (condition) {

    statement_1;
  
  } else {
    
    statement_2;
  
  }
        </code>
        condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what
        evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is
        executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
        <code>
  if (condition_1) {
            
    statement_1;

  } else if (condition_2) {
    
    statement_2;
    
  } else if (condition_n) {
  
    statement_n;
  
  } else {
  
    statement_last;
  
  } 
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed.
        To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
        to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
        <code>
  if (condition) {

    statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;

    statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true;

  } else {

    statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;

    statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false;

  }
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be
        confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
        <code>
  if (x = y) { 
    
    /* statements here */
  
  }
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional
        parentheses around the assignment. For example:
        <code>
  if ((x = y)) {
  
    /* statements here */
  
  }
        </code>
